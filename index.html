                <h2>What is an ACL injury and why is it happening so frequently in women's football?</h2>

                <p>
                  To understand why ACL injuries are such an issue in women's football we should first understand the injury.  
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>What is an ACL?</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                There are different systems that make up the human body. Two of these systems are are going to be talked about in relation to ACL injuries. These two systems are Skeletal and Muscular, the muscular system is what connects the bones of our skeletal system together and enable us to move.  
                ACL stands for Anterior Cruciate Ligament,  it is the ligament that is located in your knee. This ligament allows for a bone called the patella or your knee cap to be connected to your Femur which is your thigh bone and Tibia which is your shin bone. 
                This ligament is generally able to hold up under a lot of stress day to day however for athletes who push their limits in their chosen sports it can lead to them having a ACL injury. This can happen due to more pressure being put through the knee joint at one time, any sudden movement a athlete may make or them stopping quickly, resulting in the ACL either tearing or snapping and putting the athlete in a tremendous amount of pain. 
                This is an injury that is becoming more common place in women's football as the women's game becomes more high profile, the amount of games players are playing increases and rest time decreases. 
                Injuries obviously are not a new concept in sport or in women's football in particular, while we as human being are similar in basic structure there are many physiological differences between men and women.
                Periods can have a massive impact on a womans ability to perform at the highest level, and there have been teams within English Women's Football that have looked into this impact and how they can best manage it so it has less of a detrimental effect on the players performances.   
                </p>
                <h3>What is the recovery time from a ACL injury?</h3>
                <p>the time frame for recovering from an ACL injury can be between six and nine months, however for athletes this is significantly longer increasing to between nine and twelve months before they are advised to play a competitive match. 
                </p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                Due to the rise in ACL injuries that has been seen in the last few years and the rise of women's sport across the world, it has raised questions about investing more in researching and studying how and why women are more at risk of receiving theses types of injuries in comparison to their male counter parts.
                
                Because of the rise of ACL injuries in the women's game several organizations have decided to get together and create Project ACL they are aiming to work together with the players and clubs of the FA Women's Super League (FA WSL) to that they can try and gain a better understanding of the environments they are working in, investigate and identify the best practices and provide the best solutions for the reduction of ACL injuries in the FA WSL.  
                The organizations that have decided to collaborate on this project are the PFA (Professional Footballers Association), Nike, FIFPRO and Leeds Beckett University so that they can accelerate the research into preventing and reducing the ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) Injuries and make them more available to play games over a season.

                    "The players have rightly called for more research into ACL injury, and Project ACL is a response to both their needs and those of the industry more broadly. What makes this project stand out is it focuses on players in professional women’s football, and benefits from the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders." - <cite>Dr. Alex Culvin, FIFPRO’s Head of Strategy and Research for Women’s Football, 2024</cite>
